J.P. is an experienced research scientist specialising in **particulate mechanics** and the **Discrete Element Method (DEM)**. J.P. completed his Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh studying in the field of granular mechanics and has over 10 years research experience covering both the experimental and numerical fields.   

J.P. was the developer of a novel DEM contact model that captures the behaviour of complex cohesive granular solids. 
This contact model has been implemented in the commerical DEM code **EDEM** (now *Altair EDEM*) as the **Edinburgh Elasto-Plastic Adhesion Model (EEPA)**.
J.P. was also heavily involved in the development of the **Edinburgh Powder Tester (EPT)** whose technology was later licenced to Freeman Technologies for use in the Freeman UPT. 

Working the the numerical field of *DEM*, *programming*, *data analysis* and *visualisation* are common tasks and *python*, *Julia* and *C++* are often the tools of choice.
