  Bridges in high-intensity seismic zones are particularly vulnerable to sequential seismic events

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: "This paper presents a generic framework of Model Driven Design (MDD) with its application for a twin screw granulation process using a mechanistic-based population balance model (PBM)."
