abstract: |-
  The seismic resilience of bridge infrastructure is critical to ensuring the continued functionality of transportation networks during earthquakes. Traditional force- and displacement-based design approaches assess structural performance based on peak response 
measures. In contrast, energy-based seismic assessment offers a unified approach that inherently captures both force and deformation demands. This study examines component-level seismic energy dissipation and its impact on the global system fragility of multi-span reinforced 
concrete (RC) bridges. A high-fidelity finite element model was developed, and extensive nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted using a suite of real ground motion records. The distribution of hysteretic and damping energy across critical components, including 
columns, bearings, abutments, and shear keys, was quantified. The results indicate that hysteretic energy dissipation in bearings predominantly governs the seismic response, while damping energy remains relatively stable, governed by the structural mass and bearing 
properties. Component and system fragility curves reveal that components exhibiting higher energy dissipation drive system fragility. These findings advance the understanding of energy dissipation mechanisms and aid into retrofit prioritization strategies to enhance bridge 
resilience.
