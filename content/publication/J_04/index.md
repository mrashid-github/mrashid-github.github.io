abstract: |-
  This paper presents experimental studies on reinforced concrete moment resisting frames that have engineered cementitious composite (ECC) in plastic hinge length (PHL) of beam/column members and beam-column joints. A two-story frame structure reduced by a 1:3 scale was further tested through a shake-table (seismic simulator) using multiple levels of simulated earthquake motions. One model conformed to all the ACI-318 requirements for IMRF, whereas the second model used lower-strength concrete in the beam/column members outside PHL. The acceleration time history of the 1994 Northridge earthquake was selected and scaled to multiple levels for shake-table testing. This study reports the observed damage mechanism, lateral strength-displacement capacity curve, and the computed response parameters for each model. The tests verified that nonlinearity remained confined to beam/column ends, i.e., member joint interface. Calculated response modification factors were 11.6 and 9.6 for the code-conforming and concrete strength deficient models. Results show that the RC-ECC frame's performance in design-based and maximum considered earthquakes; without exceeding maximum permissible drift under design-base earthquake motions and not triggering any unstable mode of damage/failure under maximum considered earthquakes. This research also indicates that the introduction of ECC in PHL of the beam/column members' detailing may be relaxed for the IMRF structures.
