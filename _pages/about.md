# About me!

I am a PhD student at the University of Tsukuba with a focus on structural and earthquake engineering. My research focuses on how bridges perform under cascading seismic hazards, particularly exploring multi-directional loading and the development of fragility surfaces. Finite element analysis is central to my work, helping me predict structural performance under various scenarios. Previously, I contributed to large-scale experimental tests on frame structures, using innovative materials to boost their seismic capacity. By blending experimental and computational methods, I aim to help build safer, more resilient communities.
